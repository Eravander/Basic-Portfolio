    <p>
      My name is Dominick Geronimo, I am an author and Father of two wonderful children. I have always been a tech minded individual and have been studying programming and hardware for as long as I can remember. I custom built my own computer that I use to stream video games on Twitch at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/eravander" target="_blank">www.twitch.tv/eravander</a> and to write my Urban Fantasy books. Now I am adding coding to the list of primary uses for the machine.

      I am currently working on a novel that is tentatively titled, "Niruko". I am hoping that by the end of this class I will have the skills I need to find a primary job to support my side endeavors.
